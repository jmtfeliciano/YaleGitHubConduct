## YaleGithubConduct

My published __Code of Conduct__.  This is a set of norms I expect from everyone who will participate in Github-related events at Yale.  There is a zero-tolerance policy for any type of discrimination.  

### The basic, but important, code of conduct expected from the community:
- __Respect__ for all members of our community regardless of their educational background, race, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, etc.  tl;dr Don't be an asshole.  
- __Valuing__ different opinions and cultures, and contributing to the understanding of all.
- __Accountability__ for actions inconsistent with this Code of Conduct.

__tl;dr__ In summary, don't be an asshole. 

If you need any type of accomodation or feel maligned in any of our events, please contact me directly at josemari.feliciano@yale.edu
